# Research  
Researching into online stores and those that offer new and pre-owned media, I found that most stores have used a familiar theme and platform Shopify, so the layout can be similar or very different.  
The stores do offer many categories surrounding products, some online store offerings were either used media or new media and very few were offering both new and recycled or pre-owned media.  

I also included social media as a platform as these offer marketplaces.  
Common site features which were often offered:  
- Large selection of categories to filter options.  
- Varied descriptions from either extensive or vague.  
- Product grades for used products.  
- Promotions based on a media type or titles selected.  

When looking at the new market, because of the large offerings, even with filtering that looking for an individual title can be found but as the site’s offerings grew, the ease of finding a title increased in difficulity as promotions or sponsored slots etc. affected the presentation of goods.  

When looking at the used market, there was a common way to assess the quality and condition of an item.  
These were:  
- Grades ranging from A to D.  
- Condition ranging from Excellent through to fair.  

I found in this area that every supplier has its own way to determine these grades, advice given when asking a physical store is that guidelines are given but is ultimately up to the verifier receiving used goods.  

I have also considered the ease of use of the applications as an important factor as the application is required to be usable, understandable and accessible to a large audience.  

## User research  
I asked my family and friends, were asked for their feedback in relation to the current offerings offered by online stores and their experience with buying used media.  

### Initial questions asked  
**Question.** Have you bought online before?    
**User.** _‘Yes, many times, it is so much easier sometimes than going to the physical store.’_  
**User.** _‘Absolutely, being able to shop when I want is so much easier.’_  

**Question.** Have you bought second hand goods online before?    
**User.** _‘Yes, but I did have to ask quite a few questions before buying as I wanted to make sure it was exactly the correct item in a condition that I was happy with.’_  
**User.** _‘Once or twice, but I always stick with the things I know how they age as condition is always a worry.’_  

**Question.** Do you buy stream movies or buy physical media?  
**User.** _‘Yes, I do both, I normally find streaming some older movies is easier as I am not too sure where to buy the media.’_  
**User.** _‘We often buy a movie for when we have a movie night as our internet is not that great, and streaming can result in a lower quality we have found.’_  

**Question.** Do you always know what movie title you are looking for if purchasing a movie online?    
**User.** _‘Not always, sometimes it is the cover that makes me look 9 times out of 10.’_  
**User.** _‘Yes, I always do a good bit of reading before I commit to buying a physical copy of a film.’_  

**Question.** When buying any media, how important is knowing the condition of the product you are purchasing?    
**User.** _‘Extremely important, knowing the grades and how they are assessed is also important so I know the condition of the item I will receive.’_  
**User.** _‘Knowing that the disc is clean and in good order is the most important thing so I know there will be no issues with playing the movie.’_  

Focusing on the user interface, ease of use and payments people were asked:  

### Additional questions asked  
**Question.** Is navigation of a site and ease of use important to you?  
**User.** _‘Easy to use and being able to get to what I want are the most important things to me.’_  
**User.** _‘Navigation is important, too many options and filters confuses me, I love sites that put things into easy to understand language.’_  

**Question.** Is knowing that your checkout process is secure and protected important to you?  
**User.** _‘Always, if a site uses any strange payment system or does not tell me what they are using, I do not use that site.’_  
**User.** _‘I always stick to known payment systems, as I can always get in touch with them or contact my bank about any issues with them.’_  

## Summary
The research proved interesting and raised some points surrounding buying physical media, streaming and buying used media.  
Finding the media efficiently was a key factor and having enough information to make a purchase were also important factors.  
Condition is also an area that arose, unless new, any media needs to be in perfect working order to play, the packaging may in some cases not matter which is sometimes the criteria for other stores selling media.  

It also became clear also that larger stores can be overwhelming to some, and a simple easy to navigate interface to find a product is just as important to some as filters and features is to some.  
Looking at the proposed application, research showed that other offerings can indeed offer more features, but the projects strengths are that it can offer a positive and pleasing offering which meets the business and target audience goals and aligns with feedback.  

## Conclusion
The project meets its goals and can help by offering a suitable resource for buying media.  
The e-commerce web application will provide a simple to use accessible store that will be accessible to a wide range of audiences whilst provide a secure and reassuring experience for anyone buying through an online store.  
The store will sit alongside other offerings with a niche which offers specific offerings which are used and new DVD and Blue-Ray movie titles.
