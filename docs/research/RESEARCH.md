# Research  
Researching into online stores and those that offer new and pre-owned media, I found that most stores have used a familiar theme and platform Shopify, so the layout can be similar or very different.  
The stores do offer many categories surrounding products, some online store offerings were either used media or new media and very few were offering both new and recycled or pre-owned media.  

I also included social media as a platform as these offer marketplaces.  
Common site features which were often offered:  
- Large selection of categories to filter options.  
- Varied descriptions from either extensive or vague.  
- Product grades for used products.  
- Promotions based on a media type or titles selected.  

When looking at the new market, because of the large offerings, even with filtering that looking for an individual title can be found but as the siteâ€™s offerings grew, the ease of finding a title increased in difficulity as promotions or sponsored slots etc. affected the presentation of goods.  

When looking at the used market, there was a common way to assess the quality and condition of an item.  
These were:  
- Grades ranging from A to D.  
- Condition ranging from Excellent through to fair.  

I found in this area that every supplier has its own way to determine these grades, advice given when asking a physical store is that guidelines are given but is ultimately up to the verifier receiving used goods.  

I have also considered the ease of use of the applications as an important factor as the application is required to be usable, understandable and accessible to a large audience.
