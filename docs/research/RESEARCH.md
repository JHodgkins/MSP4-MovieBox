# Research  
Researching into online stores and those that offer new and pre-owned media, I found that most stores have used a familiar theme and platform Shopify, so the layout can be similar or very different.  
The stores do offer many categories surrounding products, some online store offerings were either used media or new media and very few were offering both new and recycled or pre-owned media.  

I also included social media as a platform as these offer marketplaces.  
Common site features which were often offered:  
- Large selection of categories to filter options.  
- Varied descriptions from either extensive or vague.  
- Product grades for used products.  
- Promotions based on a media type or titles selected.  

When looking at the new market, because of the large offerings, even with filtering that looking for an individual title can be found but as the site’s offerings grew, the ease of finding a title increased in difficulity as promotions or sponsored slots etc. affected the presentation of goods.  

When looking at the used market, there was a common way to assess the quality and condition of an item.  
These were:  
- Grades ranging from A to D.  
- Condition ranging from Excellent through to fair.  

I found in this area that every supplier has its own way to determine these grades, advice given when asking a physical store is that guidelines are given but is ultimately up to the verifier receiving used goods.  

I have also considered the ease of use of the applications as an important factor as the application is required to be usable, understandable and accessible to a large audience.  

## User research  
I asked my family and friends, were asked for their feedback in relation to the current offerings offered by online stores and their experience with buying used media.  

### Initial questions asked  
**Question.** Have you bought online before?    
**User.** _‘Yes, many times, it is so much easier sometimes than going to the physical store.’_  
**User.** _‘Absolutely, being able to shop when I want is so much easier.’_  

**Question.** Have you bought second hand goods online before?    
**User.** _‘Yes, but I did have to ask quite a few questions before buying as I wanted to make sure it was exactly the correct item in a condition that I was happy with.’_  
**User.** _‘Once or twice, but I always stick with the things I know how they age as condition is always a worry.’_  

**Question.** Do you buy stream movies or buy physical media?  
**User.** _‘Yes, I do both, I normally find streaming some older movies is easier as I am not too sure where to buy the media.’_  
**User.** _‘We often buy a movie for when we have a movie night as our internet is not that great, and streaming can result in a lower quality we have found.’_  

**Question.** Do you always know what movie title you are looking for if purchasing a movie online?    
**User.** _‘Not always, sometimes it is the cover that makes me look 9 times out of 10.’_

**Question.** When buying any media, how important is knowing the condition of the product you are purchasing?    
**User.** _‘Extremely important, knowing the grades and how they are assessed is also important so I know the condition of the item I will receive.’_  
**User.** _‘Knowing that the disc is clean and in good order is the most important thing so I know there will be no issues with playing the movie.’_
